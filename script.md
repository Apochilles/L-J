1 INT. SUBURBAN SHARE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING     1

WE OPEN on a computer screen owned by AVATAR (20’s), cautious, optimistic, nervous. Dressed in casual house attire. 

AVATAR POV

Avatar finishes writing a journal entry in a text document. In the background, half covered by the word document is an acceptance letter into university. Also on the desktop is a TODO list. The wallpaper is a stretched picture of an extremely angry Donald Duck. 

ON AVATAR’S COMPUTER SCREEN 

The journal reads: 
“I don’t know how to feel exactly.. Scared? Excited? Only time will tell. At least tonight I can relax knowing my life is finally going somewhere.”

The TODO list reads: 
“
 - Work on personal projects (which one…)
 - See doctor 
 - Call mum back”

Shortly after Avatar finishes the final line of their diary a message notification blips on the taskbar of the computer screen. The notification continues to blip until Avatar decides to click the notification and read it.

The message is from Vertigo (20’s), male, intense, passionate, controlling, unbalanced.   

The message reads: 
“Hey mate, are you interested                  in having a jam?”

Thoughts on how to reply fill Avatar’s mind. Do they have time with their current responsibilities? Their experiences collaborating with this musician haven’t been ideal in the past.

Avatar responds in the chat program:
“Sure mate, that would be cool what were you thinking?”

On the screen pops up:

"We can't be direct, we end up saying the strangest things."

Avatar reflects on how they weren’t honest with their response while dots appear on the chat program indicating Vertigo is composing a reply.

            VERTIGO
    “Yeah cool man! The usual, 
synthy kinda stuff. Units and the Screamers. Thinking we can just cut out the band stuff     and just work as the two of us.”

Avatar starts to feel more uncomfortable. Collaborating with this person in the past has been difficult. Pretty much every group they have been involved with in the past has broken up under bad circumstances. They do want to be involved with music again though.

While Avatar is thinking, speech on various volumes is heard in the background. Also, kitchen noises and footsteps.

AVATAR
      "I would be very interested”

            VERTIGO
“Nice! We can start next week. we should have at least two jams to figure stuff out. How about Wednesday and Friday.”

2 INT. SUBURBAN SHARE HOUSE - BATHROOM - AFTERNOON    2

AVATAR POV

Avatar is getting out of the shower. A message can be heard softly ringing out from across the house. Avatar gets dressed, makes his way out of the bathroom and toward the sound of the tone. The longer that Avatar is taking the louder and more shrill the message tone becomes.

Crossing through to the kitchen towards the living room Avatar notices the bins are overflowing. 

On the computer table sits a half eaten sandwich that avatar forgot to finish at lunchtime.

 
ON AVATAR’S COMPUTER SCREEN 

The journal reads: 
“I feel pretty lousy, why do we always get so wasted at band practice… Pretty glad it’s over for the week. I’m really looking forward to the sorcery pre-release tomorrow.”

The TODO list reads: 
“
 - Work on personal projects (which one…)
 - See doctor 
 - Call mum back
 - Get amp serviced
 - Email venues for gigs
 - Finish uni prep work 
”

The message reads: 
            VERTIGO
“Hey, I can’t do Sunday this week so we’ll have to do tomorrow.”

Frustration swells in Avatar. they can’t do it tomorrow, they have sorcery.
            
Avatar
“I’ve got plans mate, when were you thinking”
            
VERTIGO
“We are going to need it all day. I need to figure out this tricky lead line ”

Avatar is perplexed why this isn’t something they’re able to work on alone. 

            Avatar
“Well i’ve got Sorcery in the day but I can come over at 5”

dots appear and reappear on the chat program indicating Vertigo is overthinking a reply.


VERTIGO
“Sure, whatever. We just really need to this done ”

The dots start up again.

VERTIGO
“Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who cares about this band. ”

3 INT. SUBURBAN SHARE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING    3

AVATAR POV

Avatar is woken up by a shrill message tone. From somewhere in the room. The only light is a thin beam for the slightly ajar bedroom door. The tone begins to get more shrill as Avatar searches through drawers, clothes piles and on counter tops. While they’re searching someone slams the door shut giving Avatar a fright.

When they eventually find the phone they see that it is 3:23 am and there are two messages. 

One message reads: 

VERTIGO
“Missed calls: 5”

The message is from Windmill (20’s), female, self absorbed, Opinionated, Repressed.

The message reads:
“Can you not leave your phone ringing so long so late at night. I have work in the morning and every other day until uni starts again. Thanks” 

Avatar returns to bed. The perspective fades in and out as Avatar rolls over again and again in bed. Eventually birds can be heard and a dim light fills the room 

CUT TO:

4 INT. SUBURBAN SHARE HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON    4

AVATAR POV

Avatar sits on a back porch smoking a cigarette. They get up and walk into the house. As they turn around a message prompt flashes on the screen. Frantic scribbling and be heard inside the house.

The message reads:
“100 unread messages”

As they walk down the corridor towards the kitchen a figure moves quickly across the screen.

Avatar walks into the dimly lit kitchen. On the fridge is a note with random words in bold:

“Communal…. Shared Space… Please… ”

where the rubbish has continued to pile up. They bend down to pick it up and the screen flicks on your computer. You head towards it and login. The computer gives out a low and ominous hum. The wallpaper of Donfy Mallard has begun to look more twisted. 

ON AVATAR’S COMPUTER SCREEN 

The journal reads: 
“Saldlalsa lsadsadsadl asdlsadl dddd”

The TODO list reads: 
“
- Work on personal projects (which one…)
 - See doctor 
 - Call mum back
 - Get amp serviced
 - Email venues for gigs
 - Finish uni prep work 
 - Pay late bill
 - Something…
 - Something…
 - Something...
”

The messenger app notification tab is flashing red and looks aggressive. 

Avatar is threatened by the tab and hesitates before attempting to click on the tab. Before he can click it the tab flicks to another part of the taskbar. This happens 3 times before Avatar closes the tab. A pop up for sorcery online appears on the screen and Avatar clicks it and begins to play it.

8 INT. SUBURBAN SHARE HOUSE - BEDROOM - ????    8

AVATAR POV

Avatar wakes up in a digital version of their bedroom. The door is closed and the room is lit with artificial light. The door is lit up with three options.

(Or new idea. Have a car travelling through an environment at night. There will be turns and roundabouts that when you try to take the good exit it will redirect to a wrong exit. True emotions will then be transmitted through possibly the radio or street signs on the way.
